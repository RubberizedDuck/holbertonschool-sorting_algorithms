# Sorting algorithms & Big O Notation

## By [Hamish Ross](https://github.com/Gotmished), [Luke Hackett](https://github.com/lhack-jpeg) and Dylan Anderson

This is a project to better understand different sorting algorithms and how they can be explained with big 'O' notation.

### **About The Project**
**General**
```
- The main source for the prototypes used in the project can be found in the 'sort.h' header file.
```
**Each task contains the following**
```
- The C code containing the algorithm for the said task, the name is as follows; (task numer)-(algorithm name).c
- The big 'O' notation for each time complexity of the algorthim, 'Best', 'Average' and 'Worst'. The naming for the file is, (task number)-O
```
## Functions
- **Task 0**
    - Algorithm: Bubble Sort

- **Task 1**
    - Algorithm: Insertion Sort

- **Task 2**
    - Algorithm: Selection Sort

- **Task 3**
    - Algorithm: Quick Sort
